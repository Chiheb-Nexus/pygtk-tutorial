Contributing
------------
The PyGTK Tutorial welcomes all contributions, suggestions and constructive
criticism.

If you wish to contribute text or code, please use a recent version of the
gitorious repository as this is often updated every couple of days and provides
the most up-to-date version of the tutorial.

The tutorial uses docbook which allows for the text to be structured, and then
compiled into the HTML and PDF files the tutorial provides. It is simply XML, with
tags that state how a piece of text should be displayed. Common tag examples
include:
    <programlisting></programlisting> - displays code samples
    <title></title> - page or section titles
    <para></para> - paragraphs of text used for most of the writings
    <simplesect></simplesect> - provide sections within a page
    <sect1></sect1> - provide sections within a topic
    
Each topic has its own file within the tutorial, except in cases where items are
related. For example, information on buttons and labels go in separate files, but
information about cellrenderers go in a single file, separated using <sect1> tags.

There are also several folders used by the tutorial. The source directory contains
the XML files, the examples folder contains the code samples and the resources
directory is used to contain supplmentary files such as images, text files, sound 
clips, etc.

When adding new pages to the tutorial, it is important to ensure that the new page
is added to the contents.xml file. This file is read at compile time, to identify
the chapters of the tutorial. If a file is not included on this page, it will
not be compiled.


License
-------
The text and code samples included in this tutorial are released in the Public
Domain. Any text or code samples donated to the project need to also be made
Public Domain.

Supplementary files such as the GTK+ logo, used by some code examples are
released under a particular license.


Requirements
------------
There are several pieces of software required to compile the docbook source. The
following are the name of packages found on Debian-based distros. Other distros
may use different package names:
    xsltproc
    dblatex
    build-essential


Compile
-------
To create the HTML or PDF files from the XML source, enter:
    make tutorial-html
    make tutorial-pdf

Afterwards, you can make a tarball package containing all the HTML, images, resources and examples with:
    make tutorial-dist

If you want a tarball containing the uncompiled source, use:
    make tutorial-src

To delete all previously compiled tutorial files, including tarballs, use:
    make clean

Note: Due to the length of the tutorial, it may take around one or two minutes to 
compile the HTML and PDF files.
